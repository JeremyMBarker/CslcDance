Stepmania game created by CLSC at MTU

Notes On Adding Songs:
* You need to create a "Songs" directory in the root of the game.
  * When Editing this means the Unity project folder.
  * When the game is built, this means alongside the exe.
* Make sure to add song packs.
  * I haven't made anything to handle 'stray' songs, so for now individual songs can be put in 'Non-pack' directory
    * This really shouldn't be a problem to implement, but it would require work in the UI (which doesn't exist yet)
